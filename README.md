What is TinyAi?

TinyAi is C/C++ Code for machine learning with corresponding study notes.
Author want to learning classic learning algorithms , Coding in C/C++ , wirte study notes at same time to consolidate the algorithms that i have learned.

it is study notes at very beginning. 

but moreover ..
Author wants transplant machine learning algorithms into embedded platform(MCU ARM Linux etc). That is why i use C/C++ as primary programming language.

Some code will transplanted form kaldi or other famous open-source respority.
